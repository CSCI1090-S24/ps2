# Problem Set 2
### Due Friday, January 26, 2024, at 11:59pm EST

As with PS1, you will be accessing and submitting this problem set using GitHub Classroom. As a reminder, here's how that goes:

1. Accept the invitation you found on Canvas in Problem Set 2 (which you have already done if you are here).

2, [Read PS1 Part 4 to review how to clone a problem set repository and how to work on it locally.](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/ps1/blob/main/README.md#part-4-clone-your-copy-of-the-repository-to-your-own-machine) **As described in PS1, you need to remember where you cloned your repo to on your own machine!**

3. Edit the files on your computer in this repository as described in the sections below.

4. [Reead PS1 Part 9 to review how to submit your work to GitHub Classroom from your local machine up to GitHub on the internet.](https://github.com/CSCI1090-S24/ps1/blob/main/README.md#part-9-commit-your-work-to-github-classroom-using-the-github-desktop-app). Remember that you can commit and push your work as many times as you like. I recommend doing it often so that you have a backup of your work in case your computer breaks!

**NOTE: This respository is nearly empty. That's because you will be creating Python programs yourself, putting them (or creating them) in this directory, and pushing and committing them to GitHub.**


## Part 1

You are going to create a simple Python program. Here's how to do that. You will be doing this for parts 2, 3, and 4, as well, so pay attention.

1. Launch IDLE.
2. Go to `File -> New file`. A new window will open.
3. Go to `File -> Save`. A dialog window will pop up where you can enter the name of the Python file and where you want to save it:

4. Enter the file name `ps2-part1.py` in the `Save As` box.

5. Within the dialog box, you now have to navigate to wherever you decided to clone this PS2 repository.  If you're on a Mac and it's giving you limited options where to save your file, click the little arrow circled in the screenshot below. That will give you a real Finder-type window where you can navigate to wherever you saved the repo.

**Recall that I suggest cloning all your GitHub problem set repos to a folder called `DataScience` or `CSCI1090` on your Desktop or in your Documents folder. You can go look in GitHub Desktop to where you actually cloned this repository.**

6. Now you have a Python program you can edit! This is what you should make your program do.

* Ask the user for a number between 10 and 100. Save that to a variable called `firstnum`.
* Ask the user for a second number less than 4. Save that to a variable called `secondnum`.
* Print out their sum (`firstnum + secondnum`), difference (`firstnum - secondnum`), and product.
* Print out the first number raised to the power of the second number.
